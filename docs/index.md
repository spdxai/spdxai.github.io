# SPDX AI Working Group

Welcome to the **SPDX AI Working Group** website. This technical working group focuses on developing and maintaining the AI and Dataset profiles of the SPDX specification.

## About

The SPDX AI Working Group is dedicated to creating standards for documenting artificial intelligence systems and datasets in a standardized format. Our work enables transparency, reproducibility, and compliance in AI development through standardized Bill of Materials (BOM) practices.

## Mission

Our mission is to:

- Develop and maintain AI and Dataset profiles for SPDX specification
- Create comprehensive documentation and examples
- Facilitate collaboration among industry stakeholders
- Promote best practices for AI transparency and accountability

## Key Areas of Work

### AI Profile
The AI Profile defines how to document AI/ML models, including:

- Model architecture and parameters
- Training data and methodologies
- Performance metrics and evaluation
- Dependencies and runtime requirements

### Dataset Profile
The Dataset Profile specifies how to document datasets used in AI/ML systems:

- Data sources and provenance
- Data collection and processing methods
- Data quality and statistics
- Licensing and usage restrictions

## Get Involved

We welcome participation from all interested parties. Join our meetings, contribute to discussions, and help shape the future of AI transparency standards.
