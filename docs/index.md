Welcome to the **SPDX AI Working Group** website.

This technical working group focuses on developing and maintaining the AI and
Dataset profiles of the System Package Data Exchange™ (SPDX®) specification.

## About

The SPDX AI Working Group is dedicated to creating standards for documenting
artificial intelligence systems and datasets in a standardized format.
Our work enables safety, transparency, and compliance in AI development through
standardized Bill of Materials (BOM) practices.

## Mission

Our mission is to:

- Develop and maintain AI and Dataset profiles for SPDX specification
- Create comprehensive documentation and examples
- Facilitate collaboration among industry stakeholders
- Promote best practices for AI transparency and accountability

## Key areas of work

### AI profile

The [AI profile][ai-profile] defines how to document AI/ML models, including:

- Model architecture and parameters
- Training data and methodologies
- Performance metrics and evaluation
- Dependencies and runtime requirements

### Dataset profile

The [Dataset profile][dataset-profile] specifies how to document datasets,
including but not limited to the usages in AI/ML systems:

- Data sources and provenance
- Data collection and processing methods
- Data quality and statistics
- Licensing and usage restrictions
